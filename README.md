# A-Data-Driven-Approach-to-Sales-Forecasting
This ML project predicts Walmart weekly sales from 45 stores using features like holidays, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment. We compare Linear Regression and Random Forest models through data exploration, visualization, training, evaluation, and deployment for optimized inventory management.

Methodology

Data Exploration: Loading data, checking for missing values, and understanding feature distributions

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing sales trends, holiday impacts, seasonal patterns, and feature correlations

Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful time-based features from date information

Model Development: Training and comparing multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression and Random Forest

Model Evaluation: Using performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score

Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying which factors most significantly impact sales predictions

Model Deployment: Saving the trained model for future predictions

Expected Outcomes

The project delivers a trained, deployable model capable of predicting weekly sales with quantifiable accuracy. Through model comparison, we identify the best-performing algorithm and gain insights into the key drivers of sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for retail operations.
